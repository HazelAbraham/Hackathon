# Hackathon
Hackathon Conducted by Technology for all 


The Tasks were like this :

Step - 1: Download the csv file and read it in a Pandas Dataframe. Handle missing values and treat outliers. Donâ€™t forget to visualise the data.

Dataset Link - data.csv 

Step - 2: Train different Machine Learning models:
Logistic Regression
SVM with Linear Kernel
SVM with RBF Kernel
Decision Tree
KNN

Step - 3: Perform proper hyperparameter tuning for each model from Step - 2 

Step - 4: Compare all the models and write your observations i.e. why is one model better than the other?

Add this observation at the end of your jupyter notebook

Hint: Try to visualise the data 

Step - 5: Upload your Jupyter Notebook on Github or Google Drive and submit the link in the form mentioned below. 

# Note:
### I have used Logistic regression , KNN  Classifer and  Decision tree Classifier

### Hyper parameter tuining is done on KNN Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier 

### SVC model not used.
